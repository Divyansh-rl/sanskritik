Adding + in random order is probably failing  for both topics and sections fix that why so, we have to do that in order
Section thing is done start with adding subtopics tom. and dfinally paragraphs after that

Problems:

1. flaws in the add topics logic cant fix rn 
problem: topic ref or state is same for every new input hence not able to maintain it properly
probable fix: create an array which is dynamic creating and destroying for every state
also the array already exist for topic is not able to remove element dynamically after submitting the request and deleting the input
use better dsa for that



 subtopics done
 One problem remaining for already existing
 when original subtopic input is there request and everything is working fine but its not getting showing up on frontend instantly
 this is working fine for increasing subtopics input
 fix it then work for deleting logic + make a card appearing are you sure you want to delete it

 when deleting a topic while sections and subtopics are present give two options
 proceed with deleting its children first or 
 are you sure you want to delete whole topic all its children will get deleted as well  (IN RED)
 if yes then delete all its children as well

  paragraphs remaining
